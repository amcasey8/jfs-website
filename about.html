    <!-- About the Researcher Section -->
    <section id="about-researcher">
        <p>Alex Casey (pictured) is a writer and geographer by trade, and a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of Oregon. Her M.S. thesis explored the construction of wildfire hazard in Oregon's SB 762/80 maps. Alex holds a B.A. in Global Studies with a focus in Arabic and Sustainable Development from the University of California, Berkeley, where she researched ecotourism development in Jordan and graduated with high honors.</p>

        <p>Her current work, funded in part by the Joint Fire Sciences Program, focuses on the implementation of Oregon’s Senate Bill 762/80, and how wildfire policy and hazard mapping can work better for communities. Her next project, inspired by concerns heard throughout Oregon's wildfire hazard map process, seeks to understand the scope and scale of home insurance issues throughout the Pacific Northwest.</p>
       
        <p>In addition to her research at the University of Oregon, Alex has collaborated with institutions such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Climate and Community Project.</p>
